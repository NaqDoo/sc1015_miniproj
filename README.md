## **About**

We will be exploring the Heart Failure Prediction Dataset from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction/data).

Structure: 
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Logistic Regression Model
3. Random Forest Regression Model

## Aim
Predicting whether a patient is susceptible to heart failure based on the attributes provided. The problem is a binary classification problem (having a heart disease (1) and not having one (0)).
