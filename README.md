## **About**

We will be exploring the Heart Failure Prediction Dataset from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction/data).

Structure: 
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Logistic Regression Model
3. Random Forest Regression Model

## Aim
Predicting whether a patient is susceptible to heart failure based on the attributes provided. The problem is a binary classification problem (having a heart disease (1) and not having one (0)).

## Models Used 

- Logistic Regression
    - ___
- Random Forest Regression
    - Categorical data was converted to integer for this model to be applied.
    - Regression Model did not perform well with heart attack dataset as the R^2 decresed with test set and MSE increased instead. 
 
## Conclusion

## Knowledged gained from project
Performing random forest regression
Extracting count of top 10 values of a feature
Collaboration on Github
